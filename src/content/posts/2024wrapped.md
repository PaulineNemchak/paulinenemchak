Haven't made any plans for this year, my only task for this year was to survive. It's been difficult mentally but things are getting better.

I wanted to read more fiction this year and I failed abysmally, I still read books about politics more than anything else and magazines like The Economist even more often.

I managed to finish only a few books this year anyways:
- "Determined" by Robert Sapolsky
- "But what can I do" by Alastair Campbell
- Read some chapters I needed for the ADC workshop in "Generative Deep Learning" by David Foster
- Read d&d stuff like the whole player's manual and spire book
- "Computer Networks" by Natalia and Victor Olifer (1k pages about all and nothing at the same time, hated it)
- Really loved the latest Dune film and it made me read the book, which I'm doing now, but I can say that I like the film better so far

I don't want to make big plans regarding books because I want to go through "Computer Systems" by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron, after years with front-end I crave programming on a lower level, with excercises it definitely will take a while.

I attended my first ADC and it was very good but overwhelming, more overwhelming than MCM London in fact, every day of the conference I was getting back home and I barely had energy to take shower and get to sleep. I really hope that either this or next year I will prepare a talk or a workshop, I've noticed that using WebView is now a thing and I might teach C++ developers how to write HTML and CSS :D

I spend a lot of my time playing games and it helps my mental health more than anything. I love comic cons now and people who make a lot of effort to show their love to the games through art or cosplay. I'm slowly poking around some stuff related to mods but my knowledge of game development is very low yet (I don't want to go into game dev, the competition should be insane, but I like doing something just for myself or the community).

It was a year when I lost my hope in Google completely after they closed google podcasts and yet fell in love with Go.

I don't believe that the next year will be any better, but I will keep doing what I can and support people from my communities as much as I can.
